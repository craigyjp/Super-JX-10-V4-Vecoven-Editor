# Super-JX-10-V4-Vecoven-Editor

I bought a reasonably cheap JX-10 internals and decided to build it into a CME UF-70 MIDI Controller with an editor to control the parameters.

But then I saw a project where an MKS-70 was being edited over USB with a serial port directly connected to the voice cards. 

I realised that the JX-10 voice boards are pretty much self contained 6 voice synthesisers that just need a few signals and a data line to control them.

So I decided that rather than connect my editor to the JX-10 assigner, I could bypass the assigner completely and build my own assigner/editor/patch manager based on the information I had learnt building the Jupiter 8 style synth from two JP-08 synths. 

It's early days but I am just about ready to connect the assigner to the voice cards and start testing.
